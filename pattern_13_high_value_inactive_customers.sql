/*
Pattern 13 â€” High-Value Inactive Customers

Objective:
Identify customers who have NOT placed any orders in the last 90 days,
but whose lifetime total order value ranks in the top 25% of all customers.

Tables:
- Sales.Customers
- Sales.Orders
- Sales.OrderLines

Logic:
1. Calculate total lifetime sales (including tax) for each customer.
2. Rank customers into quartiles by total lifetime sales using NTILE(4).
3. Find the most recent order date per customer.
4. Select customers in the top quartile (top 25% spenders) who have not ordered in the last 90 days or have never ordered.
