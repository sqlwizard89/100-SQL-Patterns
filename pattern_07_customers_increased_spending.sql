Pattern 07 â€” Customers Who Increased Their Spending (Last 60 Days)

Objective:
Identify customers who have increased their total spending in the last 30 days
compared to the previous 30-day period (31-60 days ago).

Tables:
- sales.Invoices
- sales.InvoiceLines
- sales.Customers

Logic:
1. Calculate total spending per customer in the last 30 days.
2. Calculate total spending per customer in the previous 30-day period.
3. Join the two datasets on CustomerName.
4. Select customers where recent spending > previous spending.
5. Calculate absolute spending growth and percent growth.
