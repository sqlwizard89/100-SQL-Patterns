Welcome to the **100 SQL Patterns** project â€” a growing library of real-world SQL queries designed to tackle business problems, interview scenarios, and data analytics challenges using the **World Wide Importers** dataset.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside

- âœ… Real business case-driven SQL patterns
- âœ… Covers filtering, joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, aggregations & more
- âœ… Patterns sourced from actual interview prep (Walmart, Amex, Barclays, etc.)
- âœ… Designed for analysts, BI engineers, and aspiring data scientists

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each pattern is stored in a `.sql` file and follows this naming format:

pattern_XX_pattern_description.sql

Each file includes:
- Problem case and business context
- Tables and schema used
- SQL query with comments
