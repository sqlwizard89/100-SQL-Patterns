üìò Pattern 13 ‚Äî High-Value Inactive Customers

üîç Objective  
Identify customers who have **not placed any orders in the last 90 days**, but whose **lifetime total order value** ranks in the **top 25%** of all customers.

This helps target valuable customers who may have recently become inactive.

üß† Skills Covered  
- Aggregations (SUM)  
- Window functions (NTILE)  
- Date filtering and inactivity detection  
- Joins and conditional filtering

üßæ Problem Statement  
Calculate each customer's total lifetime sales from all orders.  
Rank customers into quartiles by lifetime sales.  
Find the last order date for each customer.  
Return only customers in the top 25% (highest spenders) who have not ordered in the last 90 days or never ordered.

üß± Tables Used  
- Sales.Customers  
- Sales.Orders  
- Sales.OrderLines
