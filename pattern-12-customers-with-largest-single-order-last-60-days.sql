/*
Pattern 12 â€” Customers with Largest Single Order in Last 60 Days Compared to Previous Orders

Objective:
Identify customers whose most recent single order (within the last 60 days) is larger than any of their previous orders in that timeframe.

Tables:
- Sales.Customers
- Sales.Orders
- Sales.OrderLines

Logic:
1. Calculate total value (including tax) for each order in the last 60 days per customer.
2. Assign row numbers to find the most recent order per customer.
3. Find the max order total excluding the most recent order.
4. Compare the most recent order total to the historical max.
5. Flag customers whose recent order is the highest.
