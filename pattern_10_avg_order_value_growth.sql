/*
Pattern 10 â€” Average Order Value Growth (Recent 30 Days vs. Previous 30 Days)

Objective:
Measure per-customer growth in average order value (AOV) by comparing recent and previous 30-day windows.

Tables:
- sales.Orders
- sales.OrderLines
- sales.Customers

Logic:
1. Calculate total order value with tax and number of unique orders per customer.
2. Compute AOV = Total Value / Order Count for both recent and previous windows.
3. Identify customers whose AOV increased.
4. Calculate absolute and percentage growth in AOV.
